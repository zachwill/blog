Recently finished reading **Checklist Manifesto**, and thought this excerpt was
great:

> Some years ago Geoff Smart, a PhD psychologist who was then at Claremont
> Graduate University, conducted a [revealing research
> project](https://fusionmx.babson.edu/entrep/fer/papers98/XX/XX_E/XX_E.html).
> He studied fifty-one venture capitalists, people who make gutsy, high-risk,
> multimillion-dollar investments in unproven start-up companies. Their work is
> quite unlike that of money managers, who invest in established companies with
> track records and public financial statements one can analyze.

> Smart specifically studied how such people made their most difficult decision
> in judging whether to give an entrepreneur money. You would think that this
> would be whether the entrepreneur’s idea is actually a good one. But finding a
> good idea is apparently not all that hard. Finding a good entrepreneur who can
> execute a good idea is a different matter entirely. One needs to find a person
> who can work long hours, build a team, handle the pressures and setbacks,
> among technical people and problems alike, and stick with the effort for years
> on end without getting distracted or going insane. Such people are rare and
> extremely hard to spot.

> Smart identified a half dozen different ways the venture capitalists decided
> they’d found such an entrepreneur. __Art Critics__ assessed entrepreneurs
> almost at a glance, the way an art critic can asses the quality of a painting
> — intuitively and based on long experience. __Sponges__ took more time
> gathering information about their targets, soaking up whatever they could from
> interviews, on-site visits, references, and the like. Then they went with
> whatever their guts told them. One such investor told Smart, he did “due
> diligence by mucking around.”

> The __Prosecutors__ interrogated entrepreneurs aggressively, testing them with
> challenging questions about their knowledge and how they would handle random
> hypothetical situations. __Suitors__ focused more on wooing people than on
> evaluating them. __Terminators__ saw the whole effort as doomed to failure and
> skipped the evaluation part. They simply bought what they thought were the
> best ideas, fired entrepreneurs they found to be incompetent, and hired
> replacements.

> Then there were investors Smart called __Airline Captains__. They took a
> methodical, checklist-driven approach to their task. Studying past mistakes
> and lessons from others in the field, they built formal checks into their
> process. They forced themselves to be disciplined and not to skip steps, even
> when they found someone they “knew” intuitively was a real prospect.

> Smart tracked their success over time. There was no question which style was
> the most effective — and by now you should be able to guess which one: the
> Airline Captain. Those taking the checklist-driven approach had a 10%
> likelihood of later having to fire senior management for incompetence or
> concluding that their original evaluation was inaccurate. The others had at
> least a 50% likelihood.

> The Airline Captains had a median 80% return on investments studied, the
> others had 35% or less… The most interesting discovery was that, despite the
> disadvantages, most investors were either Art Critics or Sponges — intuitive
> decision makers instead of systematic analysts. Only one in eight took the
> Airline Captain approach. Smart published his findings more than a decade ago.
> He has since gone on to explain them in a best-selling business book on hiring
> called *Who*. When I asked him, now that the knowledge is out, whether the
> proportion of major investors taking the more orderly, checklist-driven
> approach has increased substantially, he could only report: “No. It’s the
> same.”

> We don’t like checklists. They can be painstaking. They’re not much fun. But I
> don’t think the issue here is mere laziness. There’s something deeper, more
> visceral going on when people ask away not only from saving lives but from
> making money. It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an
> embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly
> great among us — those we aspire to be — handle situations of high stakes and
> complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have
> protocols and checklists… Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.
