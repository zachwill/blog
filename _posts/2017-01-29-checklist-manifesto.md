Recently finished reading [Checklist Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto),
and thought this excerpt was great:

> Some years ago Geoff Smart, a PhD psychologist who was then at Claremont
> Graduate University, conducted a [revealing research
> project](https://fusionmx.babson.edu/entrep/fer/papers98/XX/XX_E/XX_E.html).
> He studied fifty-one venture capitalists, people who make gutsy, high-risk,
> multimillion-dollar investments in unproven start-up companies. Their work is
> quite unlike that of money managers, who invest in established companies with
> track records and public financial statements one can analyze...
> 
> Then there were investors Smart called _Airline Captains_. They took a
> methodical, checklist-driven approach to their task. Studying past mistakes
> and lessons from others in the field, they built formal checks into their
> process. They forced themselves to be disciplined and not to skip steps, even
> when they found someone they “knew” intuitively was a real prospect.
> 
> Smart tracked their success over time. There was no question which style was
> the most effective — and by now you should be able to guess which one: the
> Airline Captain. Those taking the checklist-driven approach had a 10%
> likelihood of later having to fire senior management for incompetence or
> concluding that their original evaluation was inaccurate. The others had at
> least a 50% likelihood.
> 
> The Airline Captains had a median 80% return on investments studied, the
> others had 35% or less… The most interesting discovery was that, despite the
> disadvantages, most investors were either Art Critics or Sponges — intuitive
> decision makers instead of systematic analysts. Only one in eight took the
> Airline Captain approach. Smart published his findings more than a decade ago.
> __When I asked him, now that the knowledge is out, whether the
> proportion of major investors taking the more orderly, checklist-driven
> approach has increased substantially, he could only report: "No. It’s the
> same."__
> 
> We don’t like checklists. They can be painstaking. They’re not much fun. But I
> don’t think the issue here is mere laziness. There’s something deeper, more
> visceral going on when people ask away not only from saving lives but from
> making money. It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an
> embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly
> great among us — those we aspire to be — handle situations of high stakes and
> complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have
> protocols and checklists... Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.
