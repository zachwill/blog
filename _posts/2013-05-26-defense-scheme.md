> **Defence Scheme No. 1** was a plan created by Canadian Director of Military
> Operations and Intelligence [Lieutenant Colonel James "Buster" Sutherland
> Brown][brown], for a Canadian counterattack of the United States.
> 
> The purpose of invading America was to allow time for Canada to prepare its
> war effort and to receive aid from Britain. According to the plan, Canadian
> flying columns stationed in Pacific Command in western Canada would
> immediately be sent to seize Seattle, Spokane, and Portland.
> 
> Troops stationed in Prairie Command would be sent to attack Fargo and Great
> Falls, then move to Minneapolis. Troops from Quebec would be sent to seize
> Albany in a surprise counterattack while Maritime troops would attack Maine.
> When resistance to the Canadians grew they would retreat to their own borders,
> destroying bridges and railways to hinder American pursuit.
> 
> In 1928, Defence Scheme No. 1 was terminated. While never fully justified,
> when declassified information about the United States' [War Plan Red][red] was
> released, Defence Scheme No. 1 demonstrated the foresight of such an operation,
> especially in that it was prepared before War Plan Red was researched.
