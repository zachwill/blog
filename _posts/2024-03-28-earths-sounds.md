> Many of these ocean-dwelling ancients evolved sophisticated sensors for light, sound, and chemicals. But, as far as we know, they did not communicate by sound. **It would take about another 200 million years or more for animals to call or sing.**
> 
> _Why did sonic communication take so long to blossom?_ We do not know for sure, and paleontologists may yet discover fossils of ancient sound makers, but it's also possible that the keen ears of listening predators muzzled life's sonic evolution. **All of the early animal predators — arthropods and fish especially — could detect vibrations in water or, later, tremors in the soil on land. To cry out was to invite death.**
> 
> No creatures sang when the seas first swarmed with animal life or when the oceans' reefs first rose. Primeval forests contained no trilling insects or chorusing vertebrate animals. **For more than nine-tenths of its history, Earth lacked any communicative sounds.** Animals signaled only by catching the eye of another, or through touch and chemicals.
