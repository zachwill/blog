> One of the best pieces of advice I ever received came from Hiroshi Mikitani,
> the CEO of Rakuten. He said everything changes at roughly every 3rd
> and 10th step.
> 
> **When you go from one person to three people it’s different.** When it’s
> just you, you know what you are doing &mdash; and then you have three people and you
> have to rethink how you are doing everything.
> 
> But when there are ten people, it’s all going to change again. And when there
> are 30 people, it will change again. Same when you reach 100 people.
> 
> **At every one of those steps everything kind of breaks. Everything.** Your
> communication systems, and your payroll, and your accounting, and customer
> support. Everything that you put into place needs to change when you put in
> those three and 10 steps.
