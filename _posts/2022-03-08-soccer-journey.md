title     : From the only fan to club president
permalink : /soccer-journey/

> When Brazilian soccer club Santa Cruz do Sul lost 4-1 to Grêmio in February
> 2012, there was only one Santa Cruz fan in the stadium — a loyal 23-year-old
> superfan named Tiago Rech. He was pictured sitting alone in the stands,
> feeling the pain of a season...
> 
> When Santa Cruz won the state FGF Cup and qualified for Copa do Brasil in
> December 2020, it was the ultimate success for Tiago personally — for it was
> he who had turned the club around as president.
> 
> "When I was around 15 years old, I started thinking about becoming a board
> member or even the club's president. I always dreamt to win a title, to make
> the difference. From being the only fan in the stadium, to election as president,
> and now a champion."
