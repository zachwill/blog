> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are
> encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal
> library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two
> categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a
> library you have! How many of these books have you read?” and the others
> &mdash; a very small minority &mdash; who get the point that a private library
> is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less
> valuable than unread ones. The library should contain *as much of what you
> don’t know* as your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight
> real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge
> and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on
> the shelves will look at you menancingly. Indeed, the more you know, the
> larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books
> an *antilibrary*.
