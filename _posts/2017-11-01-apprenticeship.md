> The principle is simple and must be engraved deeply in your mind: the goal of
> an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but
> rather the *transformation* of your mind and character â€” the first
> transformation on the way to mastery. You enter a career as an outsider. You
> are naive and full of misconceptions about this new world. Your head is full
> of dreams and fantasies about the future. Your knowledge of the world is
> subjective, based on emotions, insecurities, and limited experience. Slowly,
> you will ground yourself in reality, in the objective world represented by the
> knowledge ad skills that make people successful in it. You will learn how to
> work with others and handle criticism. In the process you will transform
> yourself form someone who is impatient and scattered into someone who is
> disciplined and focused, with mind that can handle complexity. In the end, you
> will master yourself and all of your weaknesses.
