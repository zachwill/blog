After updating the Tumblr application for iOS (and coming across [Peter
Vidani's](http://twitter.com/pter) [Dribbble
shot](http://dribbble.com/shots/718740-Tumblr-for-iPhone-3-1)), I decided to
take a stab at seeing how it worked. I ended up using both
[Crunch](http://www.pragmaticcode.com/crunch/) (for resource files) and
[Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/) (for network traffic). There's no real
voodoo involved to see how things fit together &mdash; most of what I did is
covered in this [NSScreencast episode](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/20-dissecting-apps).

The first thing you notice when looking through Tumblr's source
files? 26 different [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templates. Yeah, 26 &mdash;
and all end with a `.html` extension. 

I really hadn't noticed that the timeline was one big `UIWebView` when first
playing around with the app &mdash; in fact, for awhile (even after finding the
templates) I thought maybe each post in the timeline was its own `UIWebView`
held inside a native container. Credit where credit is due, it's an incredibly
nice web interface.

Since all the CSS and JavaScript files are included in the source, I thought it
was weird that [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) wasn't
included &mdash; and both [spin.js](http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/) and
[Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) were &mdash; but it actually makes a lot of sense.
Behind the scenes, the app's obviously using the [Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2),
but the API actually has **total control** over how the timeline looks and feels.
So much so, even the highlighted ribbons in staff posts are done via the API:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "highlighted": {
      "message": "Now presenting...",
      "icon": "http://assets.tumblr.com/unicorn.png",
      "color": "#498acc"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The API sends 20 resources at a time (posts from users you follow) for the home
timeline. Mustache templates are then used (probably with
[`GRMustache`](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache)) to create the initial HTML
document. Based on some of the comments in the app's JavaScript files (which are
incredibly well-commented and easy to read), native code is used to
detect how far the user has scrolled.

Once we reach the end of those 20 posts, the API sends 20 more, which go through
the Mustache templates to become HTML, and JavaScript is used to append those to
the current timeline. The downside to this approach (and I'm sure the engineers
are aware of it &mdash; the available code is really well-written) is when a
user agressively tries scrolling through the timeline. Frame rate drops pretty
significantly and scrolling begins to feel sluggish &mdash; native containers
like `UITableView` have had hundreds (if not thousands) of man-hours spent on
performance and cell reuse for this exact scenario.

While most users won't ever notice this &mdash; I mean, it took me a couple
hours to realize it was a single `UIWebView` even after seeing the static source
files &mdash; there is another downside. Whenever the user goes back through the
timeline a signifcant amount and then exits the application, it can take a
really long time to reload. The `UIWebView` basically has to render the giant
HTML timeline again.

But, this post isn't about a native versus HTML approach, and I've got to admit,
it's pretty cool seeing how well the API and Mustache templates mesh together.
Basically the entire "logic" behind how the home timeline is displayed exists in
the interaction between the two.

Another interesting find was the lack of `.nib` files (which is actually the
opposite of Airbnb's source). Native `UIView` files are obviously used
when the user begins writing a post (along with a really nice tab bar
animation), and are probably written in code. <strike>One comment in the
<code>Post.css</code> file indicates Storyboards are in use or will soon be used
sometime in the future.</strike> **Update**: the Storyboard comment [actually
refers](https://twitter.com/irace/status/244611981120786433) to
[storyboard.tumblr.com](http://storyboard.tumblr.com).

    For Future Bryan, this is to make Storyboard interviews look right.

Another great takeaway was how the engineers target Retina devices in CSS:

{% highlight css %}
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
    /* Retina CSS */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Moving on to other parts in the application, I'm inclined to believe that
pull-to-refresh is native (and, as a side note, I really like the use of images
throughout the UI rather than text). There are also two Core Data `.momd`
directories included in the source, one of which is named `STPersistentCache`.

After some light testing, I'm pretty sure `STPersistentCache` caches images
locally after they've come across the network twice (at least this was the case
with larger images &mdash; which no longer came over the wire). It actually
makes a lot of sense when you think about it: some of the images in the timeline
(or other views) will never be accessed again, but those that have been accessed
two or more times must be somewhat pertinent to the user.

The other `.momd` includes 20 entities that make up the basis for the types of
posts a user can make, etc. One of the newer entities is `FanMail` &mdash; which
has accompanying images in the source &mdash; but I was unable to find it when
playing around with the app (although, I haven't interacted with fans on
Tumblr).

Some other notes include Tumblr's use of [Flurry](http://www.flurry.com/) for
analytics (sends on `applicationDidEnterBackground` &mdash; standard stuff).
Also, the minimum version supported is iOS 5.0 (checked `Info.plist`).

Lastly, I could be completely wrong about some of these details. Crunch and
Charles are great tools for seeing assets and network traffic, but they're not
exactly a view source into Tumblr's Objective-C code.  I can say the CSS and
JavaScript are incredibly well-written code &mdash; within only a couple hours I was
able to see how things fit together.

As a side note, an adapted [`appcrush` script](https://gist.github.com/3191539)
could be used to do the same thing as Crunch, but I've been too lazy and Crunch
has a pretty great interface.
