> Steve and I were talking about children one time, and he said the problem with
> children is that they carry your heart with them. The exact phrase was, “It’s
> your heart running around outside your body.” That’s a Steve Jobs quote. He
> had a level of perception about feelings and emotions that was far beyond
> anything I’ve met in my entire life. His legacy will last for many years,
> through people he’s trained and people he’s influenced. But what death means
> is you can’t call—you can’t call him. It’s a loss. I’ll miss talking to him.
