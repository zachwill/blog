> The Chicken of Tomorrow award marked the rise of a vast new industry and the
> metamorphosis of the backyard bird into a technological wonder akin to
> missiles, the transistor, and the thermonuclear weapon â€” which had been
> tested for the first time six weeks earlier. The winning bird was chosen not
> for its exotic stature or pure breeding, but for its similarity to a wax
> model of the perfect carcass as devised by a team of poultry scientists. The
> grilled chicken in your sandwich or wrap comes from a descendant of the bird
> that Vantress created by crossing California Cornish males with New Hampshire
> females.
> 
> This hardy bird with just the right mix of genes weighed an average of more
> than four pounds, twice the size of a typical barnyard chicken of the day.
> The speed with which it became the industry norm is astonishing. Within a few
> years, most commercial broilers came from this stock.
> 
> **Until the early 1950s, most US flocks contained no more than 200 chickens,
> about the size advocated by ancient Roman agricultural writers 2,000 years
> earlier.**
> 
> In the wake of the Chicken of Tomorrow contest, farms raised tens of
> thousands of birds, some as many as 100,000. A hen that might live a dozen
> years on a farm could now be fattened and slaughtered in six brief weeks.
