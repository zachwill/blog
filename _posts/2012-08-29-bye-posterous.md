And, that's that. In the coming days, I'm planning on moving the majority of my
[Posterous blog posts](http://zachwill.posterous.com) over to Github. Probably
should have done this awhile back, but just never got around to it.

I can also confirm that I'm very much in love with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
