And, that's that. I'm planning on moving the majority of my [Posterous blog
posts](http://zachwill.posterous.com) over to here. Probably should have done
this awhile back, but just never got around to it.

I'm pretty happy with the current site (the layout is based off of the Github
Pages [Minimal theme](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal)). If anyone's
keeping count, this is the fifth site redesign in the past three years.

I can also confirm that I'm very much in love with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) right now. If you're interested, all of the code
is [available on Github](http://github.com/zachwill/blog).
