Originally written in 1953, but as relevant to software development as anything
I've come across:

> An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic
> characteristics: It is simple.  It is small.  It is cheap.  It is light.  It
> can be built very quickly.  It is very flexible in purpose ("omnibus
> reactor").  Very little development is required. It will use mostly
> “off-the-shelf” components.  The reactor is in the study phase. It is not
> being built now.
> 
> On the other hand, a practical reactor plant can be distinguished by the
> following characteristics: It is being built now.  It is behind schedule.  It
> is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items.
> Corrosion, in particular, is a problem.  It is very expensive.  It takes a
> long time to build because of the engineering development problems.  It is
> large.  It is heavy.  It is complicated.
> 
> The tools of the academic-reactor designer are a piece of paper and a pencil
> with an eraser. If a mistake is made, it can always be erased and changed.
> If the practical-reactor designer errs, he wears the mistake around his neck;
> it cannot be erased. Everyone can see it.
