> An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic characteristics:
> 1. It is simple.
> 2. It is small.
> 3. It is cheap.
> 4. It is light.
> 5. It can be built very quickly.
> 6. It is very flexible in purpose ("omnibus reactor").
> 7. Very little development is required. It will use mostly “off-the-shelf” components.
> 8. The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.
> 
> On the other hand, a practical reactor plant can be distinguished by the following characteristics:
> 1. It is being built now.
> 2. It is behind schedule.
> 3. It is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items.  Corrosion, in particular, is a problem.
> 4. It is very expensive.
> 5. It takes a long time to build because of the engineering development problems.
> 6. It is large.
> 7. It is heavy.
> 8. It is complicated.

> The tools of the academic-reactor designer are a piece of paper and a pencil

> If the practical-reactor designer errs, he wears the mistake around his neck;
> it cannot be erased. Everyone can see it.
