> Cosmic latte is the average color of the universe, found by a team of
> astronomers from Johns Hopkins University. In 2001, Karl Glazebrook and Ivan
> Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a greenish
> white, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2002 paper in which they
> reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 galaxies averaged
> to a slightly beigeish white. The hex triplet value for cosmic latte is
> `#FFF8E7`.
