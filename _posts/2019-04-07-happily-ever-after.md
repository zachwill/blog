A great take on _Game of Thrones_ really being the _Happily Ever After_ ending to a
book never written...

> This isn't a story that ends with _Happily Ever After_. That is where we

> 
> __This whole series is the sequel to a book never written. A classic fantasy,
> about heroes who fought against an unambiguous evil, about people who took
> their lives and their honor into their own hands and stormed the gates of the

> friend and comrade returned home to raise his family in happiness in the keep
> of his forefathers, and they all lived happily ever after.
> 
> But the brave hero doesn't know how to rule, and the beautiful woman he
