A great take on _Game of Thrones_ really being the _Happily Ever After_ ending to a
book never written...

> This isn't a story that ends with _Happily Ever After_. That is where we
> started.
> 
> __This whole series is the sequel to a book never written.__ A classic fantasy,
> about heroes who fought against an unambiguous evil, about people who took
> their lives and their honor into their own hands and stormed the gates of the
> mad king. The brave hero became king and married a beautiful woman, his
> friend and comrade returned home to raise his family in happiness in the keep
> of his forefathers, and they all lived _Happily Ever After_.
> 
> But the brave hero doesn't know how to rule, and the beautiful woman he
> married isn't just a trophy for being a legendary hero...
> 
> Last time _Happily Ever After_ happened, it fell apart. Because in reality,
> there is no end of the story. There's just a point where the author stops
> writing. And if he writes long enough, everyone ends up dead. _Happily Ever
> After_ is something that has never happened in real life. This isn't a story,
> it's a snapshot.
