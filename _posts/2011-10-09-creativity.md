> One of the foremost building architects of the twentieth century, Louis Kahn,
> offers a useful explanation of the relationship between beauty and design:
> “Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities,
> integration, love.”
> 
> Kahn explains that beauty emerges from selection. That is, art comes not so
> much from the act of creation itself but rather from selecting among a near
> infinite supply of choices.

> The musician has a near-infinite palette combining different instruments,
> rhythms, scale modes, tempo, and the hard-to-define but easy-to-sense
> “groove.” The painter starts with some 24 million distinguishable colors to
> choose from. The writer has the full breadth of the Oxford English Dictionary
> (all 20 volumes; some 300,000 main entries) from which to select the perfect
> word.
> 
> Creativity comes from the selection and assembly of just the right components
> in just the right presentation to create the work. And selection — knowing
> what to select and in what context — comes from pattern matching, and that’s a
> topic to which we’ll keep returning.
