A quote that reminded me of my favorite podcast the last few years: [Last Seen](https://www.wbur.org/lastseen).

> Given the considerable risk of being caught, or not being able to pass on
> stolen paintings with obvious recognition value, like the Turners, there is a
> genuine puzzle as to why this type of crime is undertaken at all. Making
> money, combined with a certain level of bravado, is the simplest answer.
> 
> **Because after a successful theft each stolen work of art acquires a new
> "value" in the underworld: perhaps only 10 percent of its commercial value,
> but still potentially a large sum.** This is value that can be utilized as
> collateral in criminal deals. Such motivation for thieves has significantly
> increased as the values at the top end of the fine art market have shown
> stupendous growth.
