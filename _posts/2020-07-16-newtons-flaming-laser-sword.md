From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword):

> Newton's flaming laser sword is a philosophical razor devised by Mike Alder in an
> essay titled "_Why Mathematicians and Scientists Don't like Philosophy but Do
> It Anyway_" on the conflicting positions of scientists and philosophers on
> epistemology and knowledge. **It can be summarized as "what cannot be settled by experiment is not worth
> debating".**

From the [original essay](https://philosophynow.org/issues/46/Newtons_Flaming_Laser_Sword):

> It seems to me fair game to use the flaming sword on the philosopher who
> meddles in science which he does not understand.
> 
> * When he asks questions and is willing to learn, I have no quarrel with him.
> * When he is merely trying to lure you into a word game which has no
>   prospect of leading anywhere, you have to decide if you like playing
>   that sort of game.
> 
> Mathematicians and scientists feel that they have found a more difficult but
> much more satisfying game to play. Newtonâ€™s Flaming Laser Sword is one of the
> rules of that game.
