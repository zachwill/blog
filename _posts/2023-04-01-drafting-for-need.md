One of the better NBA Draft stories:

> GM Billy Knight points out that Zaza Pachulia and Shelden Williams are the only Hawks who are wide in the thighs. "They are the only two guys we have who aren't what we call narrow butts. The other guys are thin guys, slender builds, so you need some physicality on your team."
> 
> So he's looking for one more wide butt?
> 
> "It depends on the butt," Knight said. In which case Horford may well be their pick.
