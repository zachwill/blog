> This paper interrogates concerns raised by prior research on value-added
> models (VAMs) and raises new concerns about the use of VAMs in career and
> compensation decisions. We explore the bias and reliability of commonly
> estimated VAMs by comparing estimates of teacher value-added in mathematics
> and ELA with **parallel estimates of teacher value-added on a well-measured
> biomarker that teachers should not impact: _student height_.**
> 
> Using administrative data from New York City, we find estimated teacher
> “effects” on height that are comparable in magnitude to actual teacher
> effects on math and ELA achievement, 0.22: compared to 0.29: and 0.26:
> respectively. **On its face, such results raise concerns about the validity
> of these models.**
