> Schools and districts across the country want to employ teachers who can best
> help students to learn, grow, and achieve academic success. Identifying such
> individuals is integral to schools' success but is also difficult to do in
> practice. In the face of data and measurement limitations, school leaders and
> state education departments seek low-cost, unbiased ways to observe and
> monitor the impact that their teachers have on students. Although many have
> criticized the use of value-added models (VAMs) to evaluate teachers, they
> remain a widely-used measure of teacher performance.
> 
> Yet questions remain about the reliability, validity, and practical use of
> VAMs. This paper interrogates concerns raised by prior research on VAMs and
> raises new concerns about the use of VAMs in career and compensation
> decisions. **We explore the bias and reliability of commonly estimated VAMs
> by comparing estimates of teacher value-added in mathematics and ELA with
> parallel estimates of teacher value-added on a well-measured biomarker that
> teachers should not impact: student height.**
> 
> Using administrative data from New York City, we find estimated teacher
> “effects” on height that are comparable in magnitude to actual teacher
> effects on math and ELA achievement, 0.22: compared to 0.29: and 0.26:
> respectively. **On its face, such results raise concerns about the validity
> of these models.**
