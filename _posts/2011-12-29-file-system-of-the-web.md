> **Example**: Jimmy runs a small e-commerce business. He’s not a technical person
> and understands little about how the web functions. He typically puts internet
> passwords on sticky notes around the office, and gets frustrated when he needs
> to find one. However, Jimmy spent 12 years prior working for a financial
> services firm, and knows how to mash up data in an excel spreadsheet like you
> wouldn’t believe. With Dropbox and a smart web app, Jimmy gets to manage all
> of his e-commerce product information in a local excel spreadsheet, sitting in
> that magic box on his desktop.
