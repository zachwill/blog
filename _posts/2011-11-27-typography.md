> To choose a width of column which makes the text pleasant to read is one of

> psychological effect. Overshort columns can also be disturbing because they
> interrupt the flow of reading and put the reader off by obliging the eye to
> change lines too rapidly. Lines which are too short or too long reduce the
> memorability of what is read because too much energy has to be expended. There

> accommodate an average of 10 words per line. If the text is of any length,
> this rule is of practical help. A small amount of text can be set in long or
> very short lines without disturbing the reader.

> Sufficient leading between the lines is of the first importance for easy

> neighboring lines while reading. Anything that might impair the rhythm of
> reading should be scrupulously avoided.
