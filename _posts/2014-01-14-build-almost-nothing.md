> I graduated from YCombinator a few months ago (S12 [Easel][easel]). One of the most
> interesting parts of experience was being very close to my fellow batchmates.
> I was able to see in real-time and almost first-hand all the little struggles
> and successes. I got to see a huge variety of different skill-type
> distributions – some companies with all tech founders, some with mostly
> non-tech founders – attack their problem spaces in many different ways.
> 
> As a technical guy, watching the companies who were solving non-technical
> problems was particularly eye opening. I developed an extreme appreciation and
> respect for these hustling skills. To give an overview, their approach was
> generally this: build almost nothing at first (MVP!), pound the pavement and
> get customers to pay right away for a service they do manually, then build
> things to make the manual pains go away as they get more customers. It even
> worked for one technical team – an enterprise API. When called, the API would
> just email the founders, they would do the work manually, then asynchronously
> return the result.
> 
> This approach has wormed its way into my brain and I now think about startups
> in one of two categories: tech-first and service-first.
