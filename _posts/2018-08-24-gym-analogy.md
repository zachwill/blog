> What I've told people is to imagine a world where muscle is "it".
> 
> Muscle is *The Answer*. Muscle is enlightenment. Muscle is what deep down
> every person strives for. So in that world, there are those that realize
> muscle is the answer, and they've found it.
> 
> So they write books about the wonders of muscle. They gives lectures, and
> teachings, and write books about what muscle does and how/why it is the
> answer: *Be Here Muscle*! *Just Be Muscle*! *Muscle Now*! *The Way of Muscle*!
> 
> __But hardly any of these books and teachings say: Go to the gym, pick up a ten
> pound weight. Do 15 reps, 3 sets.__ They all just simply say something along the
> lines of: *Be Muscle! Positive Thinking for Muscle!*
> 
> What I've found in meditation is so much of what we read about being
> present, about non-duality, about being calm, about "positive" thinking, etc.
> __Those are all the results, or can be the results, of putting the time in.__
> 
> The gym analogy also works in regards to daily practice. If I just sit down
> and let my mind go about its way as it normally does throughout the day, I
> have to ask myself: "Just exactly what am I doing? Why am I doing this?"
> 
> It'd be like going to the gym and just kind of meandering around. Maybe
> picking up a one pound weight, picking my nose, sitting on a machine,
> and not really pushing. Just being there for an hour and saying: "I did it!"
> 
> Meditation -- just like going to the gym -- takes focus, direction,
> commitment, and honesty with yourself.
