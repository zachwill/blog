> What I've told people is to imagine a world where muscle is "it".
> 
> Muscle is *THE ANSWER*, muscle is enlightenment, muscle is what deep down
> every person strives for. So in that world, there are those that realize
> muscle is the answer, they've found it.
> 
> So they write books about the wonders of muscle. They gives lectures and
> teachings and write books about what muscle does and how and why it is the
> answer. *Be Here Muscle*. *Just be Muscle*. *Muscle Now*. *The Way of Muscle*.
> 
> __But hardly any of these books and teachings say: Go to the gym, pick up a ten
> pound weight. Do 15 reps, 3 sets.__ They all just simply say something along the
> lines of *BE MUSCLE*. *Positive Thinking for Muscle!*
> 
> What I've found in meditation is so much of what we read about, about being
> present, about non-duality, about being calm, about "positive" thinking, etc.
> __Those are all the... results, or can be results, of putting the time in.__
> 
> The gym analogy also works in regards to daily practice. If I just sit down
> and let my mind go about its way as it normally does throughout the day, I
> have to ask myself: "Just exactly what am I doing/why am I doing that?" It'd be
> like going to the gym and just kind of meandering around, maybe picking up a 1
> pound weight, picking my nose, sitting on a machine and not really pushing,
> and being there for an hour and saying "I did it!"
> 
> Meditation, just like going to the gym, takes focus, direction, and
> commitment, and honesty with yourself.
