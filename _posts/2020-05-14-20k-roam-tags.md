#### I am not an experienced `#roamcult` aficionado, but I do think [Roam][roam] is pretty cool.

If `[[double bracket]]` backlinks are [what gets you in the door][conor-tweet] — then I've brought a
crapton of baggage with me into the doorway so far.

#### → My basic idea when wrapping my head around Roam the last month:

* I really like [Blinkist][blinkist] for book summaries.
* I really like [Smash Notes][smashnotes] and [PodcastNotes][podcastnotes] for podcast summaries.
* I would love to see all the connections between the different summaries.

## My General Roam Strategy

Unlike some of the more [advanced Roam tutorials](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam),
I've actually brought a lot of my old system over with me.

#### → I `#hashtag` quite a bit.

In general, I default to a combination of tags to keep general/interesting collections:

* `#anecdote`
* `#interesting`
* `#quote`
* `#science`

I tend to put these tags at the end of blocks:

> Cool block of text goes here. `#interesting` `#quote`

Or at the top of a page in a `Keywords` "[attribute](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/f61zea/how_to_use_attributes/)".

#### → I braindump a bunch of random thoughts into Daily Notes.

Kudos to Roam: it's really the only Daily Notes system that I have felt comfortable with
&mdash; even after trying to regularly use Day One, iA Writer, etc. for years.

#### → Tim Harford's [Messy book][messy] and Steven Whitaker's [email study][email-study] influenced my ideas on folders/searching/tags/etc.

> Whittaker and his colleagues got permission to install logging software on the
> computers of several hundred IBM office workers, and tracked around 85,000 attempts to
> find email by clicking through folders, or by using ad hoc methods.
> 
> Whittaker found that clicking through a folder tree took almost a minute, while simply
> searching took just 17 seconds. People who relied on folders took longer to find what
> they were looking for, but their hunts for the right email were no more or less
> successful.
>
> **In other words: if you just dump all your email into a folder called “archive,” you
> will find emails more quickly than if you hide them in a tidy structure of
> folders.**

In my head I always call it: _The Inbox vs Archive Method_. This is not the 
official name &mdash; it's just how I'm always able to remember the gist of it.

Bonus: I really do like `#tags` for serendipity — and I think this is where Roam shines for
my simple system. (I did something similar with Trello boards the last few years.)

## Adding Blinkist and podcast notes to Roam

> "It seemed like a nice neighborhood to have bad habits in."
>
> &mdash; Raymond Chandler

Again, my basic idea after wrapping my head around Roam:

* I really like Blinkist for book summaries.
* I really like Smash Notes and PodcastNotes for podcast summaries.
* I would love to see all the connections between the different summaries.

#### → How would I classify "connections between" summaries?

When I was importing my first few summaries and blog posts into Roam, I found I was most
interested in `PEOPLE`, `COMPANIES`, `GEOGRAPHIES`, and `WORKS_OF_ART`.

These all just happen to be [`Spacy` Named Entities][spacy].

#### → I like the gist of things for most podcasts.

For instance: I really like some of [Scott Adams'][scott-adams] ideas — particularly those in [How
to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big][fail-book] — but I don't need to hear "the power
of hypnosis" for [the 100th time][scott-adams-podcast].

## Automated Tagging with `Spacy`

#### → In the end, I used `Spacy` for tagging `PEOPLE` and `WORKS_OF_ART`.

I came away unimpressed with `Spacy`'s `GEOGRAPHY` and `ORGANIZATION` tagging for my use case — so I ended up just excluding it from the final version.

It's pretty simple Python code for adding double brackets:

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def add_brackets_to_proper_nouns(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "PERSON" and " " in ent.text:
            text = text.replace(ent.text, f"[[{ent.text}]]")
        elif ent.label_ == "WORK_OF_ART":
            text = text.replace(ent.text, f"[[{ent.text}]]")
    return text.strip()
```

And the Roam [JSON format][roam-json] is a breeze to create:

```json
{
  "title": "20,000 Roam Tags and Counting",
  "children": [{
    "string": "Super simple to use."
  }, {
    "string": "Easy to create."
  }]
}
```

#### → It's messy, but Roam is pretty useful.

I've found Roam more useful reading through summaries and finding connections than the
Jupyter notebooks I was using.

## A Few Interesting Connections

Roam has slowed down for me (it's obviously sluggish to get the page to load sometimes),
but **I have found some cool cross linking of ideas.**


#### → Few authors properly credit [Bill Klann][bill-klann] for Ford's assembly line.

Henry Ford is one of the most popular individuals written about on Blinkist &mdash;
but only [Shortcut][shortcut] does a good job setting the record straight:

* Bill Klann applied the slaughtering analogy to automobile assembly lines.
* His managers weren't even big fans of the idea at first.

> Klann told Martin that his trip to the slaughterhouse had given him an idea with big
> potential for Ford. From a process standpoint, he explained, there was no difference
> between taking things apart and putting things together. So just as Swift disassembled
> animals on a moving conveyor, couldn’t Ford assemble things using the same, efficient
> method?
> 
> “If they can kill pigs and cows that way, we can build cars that way,” Klann said.
> 
> “I don’t believe it,” Martin answered.”
> 
> Klann was insistent. “They made it work down in Chicago,” Klann said. “Why can’t we put them in here for pushing the job along the same way?”
> 
> Few recognized they were witnessing the birth of a second Industrial Revolution.

#### → Postmodernism kind of sucks.

A [few][death-of-truth] [different][mumbo-jumbo] Blinkist [summaries][fashionable-nonsense] try to tackle why
postmodernism isn't the best philosophy, but I came away loving [Alan Sokal's][sokal] hoax from [Fashionable Nonsense][fashionable-nonsense]:

> The paper was entitled "_Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative
> Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity_" and immediately after its publication, Sokal
> revealed that it was full of postmodernist mumbo-jumbo that had no meaning whatsoever.
>
> To provide evidence, Sokal used cryptically vague and obscure language in his text,
> such as: "the pi of Euclid and the G of Newton... are now perceived in their
> ineluctable historicity," or, "the putative observer becomes fatally de-centered."
>
> If that sounds completely unintelligible to you, that was Sokal's point. His hoax
> illustrated exactly how nonsensical certain areas of postmodernism had become.
>
> By using meaningless jargon to form grammatically correct sentences, and being
> sure to cite major names in the field of physics, Sokal succeeded in getting his paper
> published in the fashionable journal, _Social Text_..

#### → Intel has an interesting history &mdash; from multiple angles.

It seems like Hacker News loves [High Output Management][high-output], but turns out
that Intel's history is way more interesting than Andy Grove's management insights.
Here's a good recap from [The Intel Trinity][intel]:

> Unlike Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, Grove wasn't one of Intel's founding members. He was an
> employee with a salary, and his financial stability hinged on the success of the
> company. This made him wary of risky strategies.
> 
> It was this fear that made him so skeptical of the company's move into microprocessors.
> He wanted Intel to stick to its bread and butter, which was memory chips. Thankfully, he
> wasn't able to stop Moore and Noyce, who knew the move was the correct one. Had Grove
> quashed the idea, Intel certainly would not have become the success it turned out to be.

#### → I think I'm a gardener when it comes to notes.

> **There are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners.** 
> 
> The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They
> know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to
> have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be.
> They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first
> board up.
> 
> The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it
> is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant
> comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they
> find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.
> 
> &mdash; [George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/749309-i-think-there-are-two-types-of-writers-the-architects)

## I Also Really Like Automated Emails

I'm not solely relying on Roam for reading summaries. I'm a big believer in waking up to
automated emails.

Nightly automated emails are still my main source of reading Blinkist summaries. (Along
with simple [CatBoost models][catboost] for predicting what I like.)
