> Famously, Wikipedia isn’t a well-planned operation. Its salaried employees are
> massively outnumbered by tens of thousands of “editors” who, attracted by
> Wikipedia’s vision or irritated by its inaccuracies, take it upon themselves
> to contribute...
> 
> These contributing editors not only write articles, they also argue with each
> other. How should they describe controversial issues or track down hoaxes and
> errors? What should they do with ill-intentioned or chronically ill-behaved
> editors? How should they punctuate the movie title “Star Trek Into Darkness”?
> 
> Some pages urged users to be civil or to be neutral, for example, while
> others, written later, tried to understand what being civil, or being neutral,
> really meant. Some pages were concerned with truth, others with proper
> formatting (in case you’re wondering: Wikipedia is formally neutral on the
> Oxford Comma). Some talked about the importance of being polite, but others
> warned about how a preoccupation with politeness can undermine excellence...
> 
> __One mistake I think we will avoid is the idea that social worlds evolve toward
> a stationary state.__ Whether we look inside parliament houses or web servers,
> we see dynamism and change: new ideas and unexpected logics of development.
> Some we may find silly, outdated, or even abhorrent. Others exciting, new, or
> perplexing.
> 
> When we study the complex patterns that emerge from human interaction, we find
> laws of invention, turmoil, and creation – _not stability_.
