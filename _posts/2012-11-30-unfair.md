**How do you, when given an unbalanced (otherwise known as unfair) coin, produce a fair result?**

I was seriously at a loss as to how to even approach this problem without any
type of probabilities or statistics, but then stumbled across the answer [on this
blog](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/09/getting-fair-toss-from-biased-coin.html).

> It turns out to be fairly easy. Just follow these steps:

> 1. Flip the coin twice.
> 2. If both tosses are the same (heads-heads or tails-tails), repeat step 1.
> 3. If the tosses come up heads-tails, count the toss as heads. If the tosses
>    come up tails-heads, count it as tails.
>

{% highlight bash %}
P(HT) = P(TH)
P(H) * P(T) = P(T) * P(H)
0.6 * 0.4 = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
{% endhighlight %}

> Since both outcomes have exactly the same probability, the bias is removed.
> This method will work no matter how biased the coin you use, as long as
> there's some possibility of it coming up either heads or tails (so no
> two-headed coins allowed).

This is easily one of my favorite brain teasers.
