> Why do complex [chart patterns][patterns] form? Double tops, [double bottoms][doublebottom],
> head and shoulders, and [inverse head and shoulders][invhns]? __All about divergences__.
> 
> [Distribution patterns][dist] happen because on the lower timeframe, you have
> declining bullish momentum. In the higher timeframe, it has not experienced
> this decline of bullish momentum, because it was heavily bullish, and so as
> the shorter timeframe continues to lose bullish momentum, the higher
> timeframe's bullishness pushes the price higher and you get negative
> divergence in the shorter timeframe. The shorter timeframe maintains its
> decline in bullish momentum, finally causing the higher timeframe to weaken.

> _Bam!_

> Price pops up forming a double top. Price goes down hard. Oh but wait, the
> higher timeframe's next adjacent higher timeframe is still a bit bullish.
