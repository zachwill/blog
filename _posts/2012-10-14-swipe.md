Really enjoyed watching [Matt Gallagher's talk](http://vimeo.com/43292463) from
Swipe Conference. The majority of the talk centers around reusable classes
&mdash; definitely recommend it.

A couple quotes that stuck out for me:

> Your typical application in iOS is really an app that pulls data from the web,
> presents it to the user in some way, perhaps allows some interaction in some
> way, and possibly reuploads it. The canonical example for an iPhone app is
> really an app that you start up, it connects to the internet, it pulls some
> data, and presents it to the user.
> 
> So, if you're looking to put together a class library to solve iOS apps, that is
> normally going to be your first port of call.

> A three-screen app should be taking you less than four hours per screen.

> It doesn't mean you can't add better base class functionality than it
> provides. Remember, Apple's code has to serve everyone. But, you're only
> going to write apps yourself. You're not going to write all of the world's
> apps for them. So, it's a good idea to keep your code focused. Choosing how
> to store your data, and optimizing your workflow around that, is the best way to
> do that in terms of your program.
