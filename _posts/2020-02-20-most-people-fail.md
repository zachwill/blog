> People miss the point of the "minimum viable product" for startups.

> No, we want a minimum viable product. __The absolutely smallest set of features needed
> in order to get useful market information. How many features is that? Usually...
> zero.__
>
> An MVP can be just a slide presentation, a sales pitch, a web site, a Google ad, or a
> customer conversation. The best MVPs let you objectively measure customer response
> fast and then tweak.
>
> One quick way to start is to make a web site that claims to offer the product you'd
> eventually want to build, and then gives a signup form, and then (oops!) crashes when
> people try to buy it (or sign up). Then make some web ads to send people there based
> on certain keywords.
>
> No, not a page that says "Coming Soon!" and asks for an email address. You want a
> real, live, signup page for what looks like a real, live product. You can add the "it
> works" feature later. In the meantime, since your MVP is so cheap and fast to build,
> you can try lots of different ones, add and remove advertised features, and see how
> that changes user responses.
>
> Once you have some input like that, you can make something slightly less minimal.
> __Doing an MVP this way requires incredible self-control. Most people fail.__
