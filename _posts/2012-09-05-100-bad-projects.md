> An artist friend of mine once relayed to me a quote:
> 
> **“Everyone has 1000 bad drawings inside of them. The sooner we get those out, the sooner we can start making better drawings.”**
> 
> The same holds in programming. Maybe 100 bad projects but there is nothing you can do but get them out of you.
> 
> Between my work, homework, and research I was probably at about the 100 project mark when I started be a little less confused about what I was doing. There is nothing I can press more on the new learner than to try and push through these 100 projects as quickly as possible.
