> We have won the impossible, improbable lottery of birth. And we don’t know what
> will happen. We never can. There’s no skill in birth and death. At the
> beginning and at the end, luck reigns unchallenged. Here’s the truth: most of
> the world is noise, and we spend most of our lives trying to make sense of it.
> We are, in the end, nothing more than interpreters of static. We can never see
> beyond the present moment. We don’t know what the next card will be &mdash; and we
> don’t even know when we see it if it’s good or bad.
> 
> You can’t control what will happen, so it makes no sense to try to guess at
> it. Chance is just chance: it is neither good nor bad nor personal. Without us
> to supply meaning, it’s simple noise. The most we can do is learn to control
> what we can &mdash; our thinking, our decision processes, our reactions.
