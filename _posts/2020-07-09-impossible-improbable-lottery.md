> “Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born,”
> Richard Dawkins writes, in _Unweaving the Rainbow_. “The potential people who
> could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of
> day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts
> include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.” It’s
> mind-boggling to even consider. “In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is
> you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.”
> 
> We have won the impossible, improbable lottery of birth. And we don’t know what
> will happen. We never can. There’s no skill in birth and death. At the
> beginning and at the end, luck reigns unchallenged. Here’s the truth: most of
> the world is noise, and we spend most of our lives trying to make sense of it.
> We are, in the end, nothing more than interpreters of static. We can never see
> beyond the present moment. We don’t know what the next card will be &mdash; and we
> don’t even know when we see it if it’s good or bad.

> In 1979, Carl Sagan wrote about the awe of the universe in his notebooks, as
> a counterpoint to the irrationality of superstition and false belief. “We
> live in a universe where atoms are made in the stars; where life is sparked
> by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where
> the raw material for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion
> of a star halfway across the Galaxy,” Sagan reflects. “How pallid by
> comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience.”
