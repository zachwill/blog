[Space Jam website][space].

> I used to run the servers for this site back in 2001 and it was old then. Sad

> I'm not surprised that nothing has been cleaned up, we were still running
> Netscape Enterprise Server about 5 years after everyone else had given up on

> and the company had gone out of business so we couldn't get an Apache module.
