[Helena Fitzgerald](https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/golden-hour) is a great writer:

> The two characters from the first movie find each other again, but the point
> of the story is that finding each other undoes none of the losses of nine
> years before. They cannot ever go back to that single perfect day; even in
> love, you can only ever move forward.
> 
> Like a miracle, these two people locate each other again out of all the churn
> and unlikeliness of the whole world, but they can’t ever be with the young
> version of one another. The person they lost is still lost. They can’t ever
> have the romance they imagined having with the person they fell in love with,
> because that person no longer exists.
